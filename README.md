# Installation to run this on your local system


# Frontend installation making a build
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Go to the project directory of the frontend using "cd frontend " and ensure all the packages are installed hence use the following:
### `npm install.`
To install all the frontend packages in your system

In the project directory, you can run the following:
### `npm start.`

It runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
But this will not connect to the backend, but one can run it to check errors in the frontend program. 

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build.`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimises the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

Now backend can read the build file to get to the frontend. 

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
